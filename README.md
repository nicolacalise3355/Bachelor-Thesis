This is my bachelor's thesis in computer science at the University of Pisa.


## Topic of thesis:

With the evolution of the internet, in recent years, we have witnessed the rise of the web 3.0 and blockchain technologies. One of the main challenges of systems based on this technology is that, to retrieve data, we need to scroll through the blockchain block by block. The thesis will propose experiments using a specific data structure to try to improve its efficiency.
